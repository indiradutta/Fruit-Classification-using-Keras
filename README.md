## Steps Involved:

- Viewing classes in Directory

- Visualizing Images in Dataset from each class

- Data Configuration

- Data Preparation and Loading

    - Creating a Generator for Training Set
    - Creating a Generator for Testing Set
    
- Writing the labels into a text file 'Labels.txt 

- Model Architecture

- Model Compilation

- Training the Model (batch_size = 32, epochs = 4)

- Testing Predictions

- Deploying the Model as a Web Application using Streamlit
